                The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short Message Service (SMS). It has grown beyond
                alphanumeric text to include multimedia messages using the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Rich
                Communication Services (RCS), which can contain digital images, videos, and sound content, as well as
                ideograms known as emoji (happy faces, sad faces, and other icons), and instant messenger applications
                (usually the term is used when on mobile devices).

                Text messages are used for personal, family, business, and social purposes. Governmental and
                non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues. In the 2010s,
                the sending of short informal messages became an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier
                with emailing.[1] This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family, and
                colleagues, including in contexts where a call would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very
                late at night or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail
                and voicemail, and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient),
                texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits
                communication even between busy individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact with automated
                systems, for example, to order products or services from e-commerce websites or to participate in online
                contests. Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users
                about promotions, payment due dates, and other notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or
                voicemail.
